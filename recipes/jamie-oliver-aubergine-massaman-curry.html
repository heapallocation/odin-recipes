    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This fragrant curry is quick to make and freezes well, so portion up and fill the freezer. Using a ready-made
        curry
        paste gives you more bang for your buck.</p>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the rice in a large pan of boiling salted water to pack instructions. Chop the eggplant into 3cm
                chunks,
                place in a colander on top of the rice, cover and steam for the first 8 mins, or until starting to
                soften.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, toast the peanuts in a large non-stick frying pan until golden, tossing regularly, then crush
                using a
                pestle and mortar (or finely chop). Trim the spring onions and chop into 2cm pieces. Place in the frying
                pan
                with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and cook for 5 minutes on a medium heat, or until lightly charred, then
                remove to
                a plate.
            </li>
            <li>Use tongs to move the steamed eggplant into the frying pan to char for 5 minutes, turning often and
                removing
                to
                a plate when done â€“ you may need to work in batches.
            </li>
            <li>Chop the potatoes into 2cm chunks, add to the frying pan with the curry paste and stir for 2 minutes.
                Pour
                in
                the coconut milk and stir well, then cover and cook for 8 minutes, or until the potatoes are cooked and
                the
                sauce has thickened.
            </li>
            <li>Halve the sugar snaps lengthways and add to the pan along with the charred eggplants, then cover and
                cook
                for a
                final 2 minutes. Drain and divide the rice between bowls and spoon over the curry, top with the charred
                spring
                onions, crushed nuts and a squeeze of lime, if you like.
            </li>
        </ol>
